### <center>Link Twitch and Minecraft together!<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosrnic/TwitchLink/main/images/TwitchLinkLogo.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABW3BXBHLWZVI23KWAC3YIIYZHGUJIA" width=50% height=50% alt="Logo"></center>

## Getting started
To get started, download the mod from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/twitchlink) or the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/cosrnic/TwitchLink/releases). Make sure to also have Fabric 1.20 installed!<br />
When in-game, type `/twitchlink` and a list of sub commands should appear!

## Commands
- /twitchlink
  - connect [channel] - Connect to a Twitch Channel
  - disconnect [channel] - Disconnect from a Twitch Channel
  - list - List all the connected Channels
  - enable - Enable the Twitch Chat Link
  - disable - Disable the Twitch Chat Link

### Todo:
- Refactor/Redo Chat overlay and make it move able, maybe use [Jarvis](https://github.com/romangraef/jarvis)?
- Let the user input oauth tokens and such to:
  - send messages in chat
  - follow events
- Add a different overlay for the Subscription Events, maybe an event log? 
- Adjust Chat Overlay to be permanent and clickable (allow to delete messages from the chat maybe?)
